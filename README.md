## How to create & deploy NFT smart contract
You need an ***already deployed smart contract address*** (ETH / KLAY) to use this in ***production***.
If you are not sure on how to do this, we've created a easy-to-follow wiki for you.

Check it out [here](https://woojae-jun.gitbook.io/sendinair-nft-server/).

***ðŸš— Or you can skip this part and simply test our API with default environment file***
- We've set all the variables so you can test immediately!
